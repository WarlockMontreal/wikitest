# Consent and Conflict

As we are all players in a game, it's important to remind to always ask for content to your fellow player, whenever a scenes involve other players and other characters.
Anything that would result in damage of some kind (health, willpower, advantages...) or a permanent change (blood bonding, ghouling, embracing or even final death) must be agreed between the parties.

For any kind of conflict, both between PCs and also between PCs and SPCs there are three level of consent in this server:

- Level 1: Sparring or friendly fight
All damage are temporary (unless they are a result of a messy crit or a bestial failure) and superficial. The damage is healed at the end of the scene. Mostly used for training or simple social combat.

- Level 2: The game of Strength
At this level, all the damage incurred will be retained after the scene and must be healed as normal. If advantages are lost or damaged in the process (for example, a loss of status due to a strong conversation at the Elysium), they can be regained over time with appropriate roleplay, free of cost.
Bear in mind that aggravated damage may lead to prolonged conflict and may degenerate in a more serious level of conflict.

- Level 3: The end
At this level, everything goes. Even final death is a possibility. Advantages can be permanently lost if they are used or damaged at this level. There always be multiple warnings and confirms when this level of combat is engaged.

It's important to remind that consent needs to be agreed on both parties. In the case of a social combat, the purpose and the aim of said combat must be declared beforehand when talking about consent.
When dealing with STCs, there is *always* an assumed consent of 2. If a scene can develop towards a level 3, the staff and the other players involved need to agree beforehand.
Abusing the rules regarding consent will be threated in the same way as ignoring them. Be careful, and most importantly, be nice to the other players.

The level of the consent can both escalate and de-escalate, if all parties involved are in agreement.

Certain actions will put a character under an automatic level 3 kind of consent. Examples are being blood hunted, or in an active war with another sect or also.. Spitting in the face of the Prince at the Elysium. As staff, we'll always advice when certain actions are taken, but it's also required to use some common sense by the players.

The thematic in the game may be rough, heavy, triggering and/or distressing. If you are experiencing bleed ( https://medium.com/@sbnbusinessmods/what-is-bleed-85567dd3e526 ) or if the thematics are not of not something you want to play and you need a break or to stop a scene alltogether, please inform the staff and the other players involved.

During a social combat, it's important to remember that if a character's willpower tracker is filled with aggravated damage, the other characters can effectively do social actions towards that character at DC 1 (in equal way, a character that's torpored and filled with aggravated, cant defend themselves and physical actions against them are at DC 1). This includes actions that your character won't normally agree with or do. Be careful when engaging in social combat as it's really hard to get out of it when losing.

# Moderation

In this server we operate a three strike policy. 
Breaking the rules or the normal etiquette of a social platform will result in receiving one (or more) formal warning.

- First warning: you will be warned by the staff in your ticket.
- Second warning: you will be muted for a week and forcibly removed from your scenes, if you are in any.
- Third and last warning: you will be banned from the server.

Depending on how severe are the offenses, the staff retains the power of escalating multiple warnings at once, if needed.

Warnings can also been removed (after all, it won't be correct to hold a warning on a player for months and months) from your history after a couple of months of 'good conduct'.
