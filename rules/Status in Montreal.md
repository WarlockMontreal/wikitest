# Status and how does it work in this server

## What Status Represents

Status reflects your official recognition and authority within a faction or sect. It’s not about popularity or personal power; it’s about rank, legitimacy, and position in the hierarchy.

Different groups (Camarilla, Anarchs, Hecata, cults, etc.) may each have their own ladder of Status. In our chronicle, Status among Kindred is strictly tied to official titled positions within the sect.

**This means that at Character Creation, you can only have 1 dot of Sect Status, maximum, as any higher level is tied to a specific position.**
-# There could be very rare exception to this rule for Ancillae character that manage to create a concept that can slot in as a titled position, but they are EXTREMELY rare and to not be considered the norm in any form or shape.

## Status in Your Seat of Power

When acting within your recognized territory or position of influence (your court, your clan’s seat, or your domain of authority), you may add dice equal to your Status to Social rolls against Kindred who acknowledge that authority. You can only add Status to a Skill you already possess dots in.

Example: *Caine has 4 dots in status. They want to roll Composure + Etiquette. As they have 2 dots of Etiquette, they can add 4 dots in status for this roll, as they are currently holding an Elysium in their sect. If Caine were to roll Persuasion, for example, and they have zero dots, then they cannot add Status to the roll.*

You may substitute your Status for a single relevant Skill pool (e.g., Politics, Etiquette, Persuasion) if your position could still apply, but you cannot stack both (you either use Status as a bonus or as a Skill substitute, not both).

This represents your ability to leverage your title’s authority or institutional influence, but only when it’s relevant to the situation and the audience respects it.

**However, relying on Status as a crutch comes at a cost.**
Overusing authority instead of skill leaves an impression: subordinates see dependency, rivals see weakness, and superiors note arrogance.

## Recognition and Reputation (Gauge the Standing)

Any Kindred with Status is known, at least to some.
The higher your Status, the more likely others are to recognize you, recall your reputation, or know your history.

The pool is different depending on the type of Status.

- Roll: Intelligence or Wits + Politics (if Camarilla Status) or Occult (if Hecata or Cult status) or Streetwise (if Anarch Status)

**Base Difficulty:** 6

Modifiers:
Reduce difficulty by 1 per dot of the target’s Status(in that sect or group). If multiple apply, then they ulteriorly lower the DC

Each Margin of Success grants additional details, context, or rumors.
This keeps the social web of the power seats alive. Knowledge, gossip, and politics are weapons as sharp as fangs.

Example: *Caine has 3 dots in Camarilla Status. Abel rolls Intelligence + Politics and score 5 successes. The DC to Gauge the Standing was 3, so they have 2 successes of margin. They can ask the player of Caine for 3 details about their position, with one of those possibly being a lie or a rumor. On top of this, they would know what position Caine covers in the current Court.*

You can only roll if it's relevant to your position and sect. If you are an Anarch Fledgling, for example, you won't be able to Gauge the Standing of a random Camarilla member.

The Shunned flaw counts as Status 4 for the purpose of recognition rolls (Gauge the Standing) and Suspect count as 2.
Mortal Pretender counts as 4.


## Earning and Losing Status

Status is not automatic. It must be purchased with experience points to represent the personal investment, recognition, and political capital involved and it must follow an in game event.

*You cannot simply buy status to be in a position of power, you need to earn that position in character, in game, before being able to purchase the Status dots.*

Gaining a title gives you eligibility for that Status level, but you must still buy the Merit to benefit from it.

Losing a title or being stripped of your office removes access to the corresponding Status benefits. Losing a title might mean that you might be able to conserve some of the Status even without being tied to a position. A fallen Prince that loses their title is definitely more famous and powerful than a random fledgling with Status 1

You cannot benefit from Status belonging to another faction unless you are acknowledged within that sect’s hierarchy.

## Positions of Power

If your character has a Position of Power, then your gameplay has an high chance of impacting other people's game. Be mindful of it.

A player in a Position of Power needs to be active in the server. Long absences without notice will make you lose your position: we can't hold the game for one person's absence.

If there is a prolonged absence, the character might be stripped of their Position and the Character might have to be cardboarded by the STs. This is an extreme measure and it will only happen if something extraordinary happens.
