# Hunting

Hunting is, if not specified, at a base difficulty of 6. In named locations, there will be listed predator types in which one can hunt with their associated difficulty. If your predator type matches the hunt you are doing, you have a -1 on the listed difficulty.  
For example:  
Hunting in Downtown would be an hunting difficulty of 6.  
There is a named location, a night club called "Example" and Siren is listed at a DC 3.  
John is a Bagger. He could hunt as a Bagger at DC 6, or as a Siren at DC 3.  
Jack is a Siren, so he can hunt as a Siren at DC 2.  

An hunting attempt takes a whole scene, even if it is just one roll. One cannot hunt in the middle of a scene and come back after a single round has passed. It takes time to find a prey, hunt, drink and leave no witness.  

A human can slake up to 2 hunger safetely. At 3 hunger slaked, an human may need to roll stamina DC 2 to see if they remain conscious. They will need some kind of assistance either way, or risk to die of bleeding out. At 4 hunger slaked, the human falls unconscious and needs urgent medical attentions. With 5, the human dies as they have no more blood left.  


A successful hunt means you can not repeat the hunt in the same location. A failed hunt means you can try again at an increased difficulty.  
More than one successful hunting scene are possible during one night, but there has to be a scene with other players between each feeding. You can not spam hunting scenes without playing the game.  

# Obtaining a resonance  

Whenever an hunt is successful against a live mortal, one could roll for a random resonance with `/resonance`  

Looking for a specific resonance could be done in some particular way.  
- Using the Bloodhound merit. Another character could roll for the merit and point the 'prey' at you. You still need to successfully hunt.  
- Once per night, and this can't be assisted, you can find the correct resonance with a successfull Resolve + Insight DC 5 roll.  
- Bagged blood and blood from corpses has no resonance, same for ghoul's blood.  
- Each predator type has access to a specific resonance linked to the predator type. One can decide to hunt for one of those instead. Just add `/temperament resonance` instead of `/resonance`

Dyscrasias can be achieved by either fully draining a human with an acute Resonance or by tapping the same person over three different nights. Ping the ST team if that's something you want to do. Please disregard the automatic selectionf od the Dyscrasia offered by the Inconnu bot.  
The effects of the Dyscrasias are chosen by the staff, according to the situation.  
Requesting to drink from the same person again will require talking with the staff about the modality. The roll is supposed to be hard and it's not only about finding the person again, but also making sure they maintain the same resonance in the same way.  

Reaching Hunger 5 or drinking any other blood will remove the effect of the current resonance. A resonance can not be stored and loses it's properties in about 10 minutes.  

There is no acute Animal resonance, only fleeting and intense.  

Bagged blood always give a fleeting Empty resonance.  

Resonances are needed to learn and level up new disciplines.  
Discipline levels 1-3 require fleeting  
4 require intense  
5 require acute (the exceptions are Protean and Animalism - Intense animal resonance is enough to achieve the 5th of those disciplines)

A temperament can be increased or a resonance can be changed with a scene assisted by the STs. As modifying someone's mood so heavily is a dangerous and ethically questionable thing, you may incur in stains if you do so.  

## Obtaining blood and Resonance from a Player Character

Human PCs can give a Resonance, but for balancing purpose there are some limits regarding it, otherwise it becomes very easy to exploit:
- The Resonance is chosen by the Human's player. After all, they decide in what mood is their character.
- The temperament is rolled with a /coinflip. If it's head, then the temperament is Fleeting. If it's tail, then it's negligible.
- Intense can only be achieved in very particular and extreme circumstances that requires an ST interaction. It's extremely rare and not a simple process.
- Acute can not be achieved by player characters.

The blood loss is recovered at the same rate as advantages and backgrounds. A human that has loss 2 "Slakes" worth of hunger is tired and debilitated (suffer a -1 to all pools for the rest of the night). A human that has lost 3 or more blood points, needs medical assistance or risks to die. Always ping a ST if that happens.

## Prey Exclusions and Addictions

A character with prey exclusions always hunt at +1 DC (some prey exclusions might be at +2, but that needs to be ironed out at CC). 
Hunting without this increased difficulty means your characters gain a stain due to the prey exclusion.

Addictions works in a similar way, to find a victim that has made use of the susbtance needed, there is an increased difficulty based on the substance: 

- +1 DC : Alchool, Weed
- +2 DC: Cocaine, Meth, Speed, MDMA, Hallucinogens, lesser opiates, etc (most other street drugs)
- +3 DC: Heroin

And again, similarly to a prey exclusions, a character that hunts without the increased DC will not be able to satisfy the flaw and as such they will receive the effects of the flaw.
A successfull hunt with the appropriate higher DC means that the kindred manages to feed on someone that has used the substance and so they receive the effects of said substance as written in the book.

Those effects lasts for 2 scenes after the hunt (generally for most if not all night), or until the kindreed feeds again or reaches hunger 5.
