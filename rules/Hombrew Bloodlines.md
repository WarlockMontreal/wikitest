# Hombrew Bloodlines

The bloodlines posted here are homebrew in one way or another. They might be reworked alltogether if/when official content regarding them will drop.

* &#x20;Koldunic Tzimisce

They are be able to pick Blood Sorcery instead of Protean at Character Creation as in-clan discipline. Their mandatory first power in Blood Sorcery is Koldunic Sorcery, which can also only be taken once. What other powers can they take by leveling up the discipline it's up for discussion still, so expect it to be a more limited pool compared to Tremere and Banu Haqim. Moreover, we are not accepting fledgling in this spot and even Neonates will be spare and the character creation will be thorough. It's an intricate Bloodline that require an advanced knowledge of the game and it's lore to be played correctly.

* &#x20;Sorcerer Ministry

They are proficient of the ancient art of Setite Sorcery. Their in clan spread for disciplines is Blood Sorcery, Protean and Presence. Same as the Koldunic Tzimisce, the powers and rituals they can take by leveling up Blood Sorcery are still under pending review. They prefer Rituals and Powers that let them discover information about other kindred. The Church of Set Loresheet is almost mandatory for them as this is where they draw their powers and their beliefs from.
