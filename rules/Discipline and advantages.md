# Discipline and advantages

## Disciplines

Is it possible to learn the three in clan disciplines without any issue, by spending experience and having the correct resonance. Blood sorcery cannot be considered between the three starter disciplines of a Caitiff. Clans that have Blood Sorcery in clan can take new dots without a mentor or a library. Everyone else needs one or the other to be able to level up the discipline. Rituals all need to be learnt through studying. Learning Blood Sorcery gives access to a level one ritual as well. Same for Oblivion, but the necromancy side of the discipline uses the same rules as Blood Sorcery.

To learn a discipline that's not part of the character's in-clan spread, they need to drink the blood of a character that either has the discipline in clan, or has dots in the discipline. For example, drinking from a Toreador (Auspex 3, Presence 2, Potence 2) gives access to Auspex, Presence, Celerity and Potence.

In-clan amalgam can be learnt without any outside training.

* To learn another clan's amalgam, you need to drink the blood of a kindred that knows that amalgam _and_ have it taught.

This is a list of all the Amalgams and their Prerequisites and the Clans they belong to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsRuJvNhWgACypbBHXdonLMCJKtzHuHFUM0bywGPLsg/edit?usp=sharing

### Ceremonies and Rituals

Ceremonies and Rituals both need study and research to be learnt. A character can roll Intelligence + Occult once per night to work towards those goals. The number of successes required to buy the Ritual or the Ceremony wanted is 10x the level of the Ritual/Cerimony. During time skip, it's possible to repeat this roll 4 times. Some projects, plot rewards and other extraordinary situations might reduce the number of successess needed or eliminate them alltogether, at Storyteller discreption.

To study towards those goals, one character needs to be in a suitable enviroinment. While we dont want to put the need for a mandatory Mawla or Library, we also don't want to make this rolls as a blanket cop-out scenario. A Tremere that has no links to the local Chantries, for example, wont be able to learn Rituals. A Banu haqim that is not connected with the other Blood Sorcerer of the domain will have an hard time at learning Rituals. A Gangrel that has obtained Oblivion through unofficial channels has no way to study Ceremonies, for example.

### Learning rituals/ceremonies/formulae

To learn a ritual/ceremony/formula, the process is as follow:

* have enough exp for the ritual to begin with
* open an experience spend ticket and discuss with the staff the ritual and the learning way (examples being "i have a teacher" "i'm a tremere with access to the chantry" "i stole this ritual in a quest" "i've got a book of recipes for alchemy" etc)
* do the required rolls and achieve the necessary number of successes
* send an updated sheet with the ritual and we tally the exp

### Restricted rituals/ceremonies/formulae

Some powers and rituals are restricted to specific clan, sects, cults, factions... Few notable examples include:

* Koldunic Sorcery being exclusive to Tzimisce Koldun
* ALL THE AMALGAMS are of a specific clan/cult
* _One with the blade_ is considered a Banu Haqim ritual
* _Coax the garden_ being bahari only
* _Traveler's call_ being a shalimnite only

This does NOT mean that you cannot learn it if you dont fit the criteria. This means that you need an in game justification, a way to reach for said knowledge one way or another.

For example:

* "a banu haqim owed me a favour and i asked them to teach me the ritual"
* "i blood bonded and manipulated a tzimisce into teaching me koldun"
* "i have a ravnos in my coterie that taught me chimestry"

There are also other condition that we might take in consideration when approving or denying restricted powers and rituals. It is worth to ask if you think you might have a justification for the restricted power you are after.

### Wards

According to the corebook, there are three types of wards:

* Warded (Haven Merit)
* Wards Against X (Ritual)
* Warding Circle Against X (Ritual)

For semplicity we decided to put them all together in one single ritual, which will be the "_Ward Against X_". Moreover, this ritual can be taken by all school of sorcery (Tremere, Ministry, Koldun, Banu Haqim, etc) and can also be taken as a Ceremony and as a Formula. The prerequisite to learn the Ritual is to have Occult ●●●.

To get the _Warded_ haven merit, you will need to perform the ritual (or have someone perform it for you) and buy the merit as normal with experience. This means that even if you are the one buying the ritual, to perform it in a permanent manner on your haven, you will need to spend experience to buy the merit. Each dot of the merit adds to a different entity according to the ritual used. The ritual _"Ward against Ghouls"_ will give you the Warded merit against ghouls. If you also perform "_Ward against Lupines_", the merit will work against werewolves as well and now it will be considered a 2 dot for the purpose of both wards.

Warded items and places needs to be approved by the staff (so we can keep track of them).

Warded items do not work in an offensive way. A Warded Sword won't deal more damage if swung against someone, but if that someone picks the Sword up, then it will deal damage accordingly. A warded piece of clothing won't deal damage in a combat situation when the sorcerer is getting punched, for example, but if someone tries to pickpocket a warded jacket then the ward will activate and deal damage accordingly. A warded door that's slammed to a victim's face won't deal extra damage to them. But if said victim directly interacts with the door, then the ward will activate and work as normal.

## Thin Blood Alchemy

Learning Thin Blood Alchemy: First of all, you need the first dot of the "discipline", either by obtaining the merit or by spending experience to learn the first dot. When obtaining the Thin Blood Alchemy \[TBA from now on] merit, you gain a free dot in the 'discipline' and you decide on a distillation method.

The method can't be changed, however you may be able to learn TBA from scratch again as if it was another discipline and upon spending the necessary experience, you may learn how to use a secondary distillation method.

Unless you are trying to learn cult or exclusive formulae, \[like the ashfinders cult] you don't need a Mawla or a library, even if one could help with learning faster or give you access to those restricted formulae. You obtain a new formula every time you gain a dot in TBA of an equal or lesser level.

More formulae can be learnt, but they require an experience expenditure \[3x the level of the formula] and appropriate research. The research could be done with an appropriate roll. The more common is Intelligence + Occult \[alchemy spec], but sometime the case could be made to use different skills, Science \[chemistry spec] for example. Teamwork, Mawla, Laboratory and Haven dots could be used when researching.

Successes needed varies according to what you are researching on:

* New level of TBA: 5x level
* New formula: 5x level
* New counterfeit formula: 10x level

Creating a formula: There are 3 types of distillation Method:

* Athanor: You are the pot, you brew the formula into yourself
* Calcinatio: You brew into another person, usually herd
* Fixatio: You brew into containers and store into jars, bottles or bags

Pro and cons:

* Athanor: you can only craft one and store one. However, you can activate them at any moment, much alike a normal discipline. It also makes a bit easier to collect the resonances, as you need to drink them instead of storing them. Usually the power will last a whole night but you can only have one active at the time
* Calcinatio: you are limited by your herd \[and herd size] when it comes to storing and if you need a power, you need your herd, which makes it harder to plan scenes around it. However, once you store a potion in a human, you can tap them and then they will keep the formula on them as long as they keep the same emotion \[resonance]. Tapping a vessel from a formula harms them depending on the level of the formula, so tapping high level formula may harm them or kill them. However, as Athanor, most powers last the whole night.
* Fixatio: You craft in a lab, so you are limited by how good and big your lab is. You can create formula without a lab, but it's harder \[you will incur in a -2 malus if you do so]. Some higher level formula would be hard \[if not impossible] to create without a lab, as it's hard to maintain a proper environment for longer periods of time. However, once crafted you may store the formula on a shelf, fridge, cabinet... The number of brew you can store is equal to 2 times your haven+tba. On your person, you can only carry a number of brews equal to the highest one between wits and dexterity. Fixatio allows for more flexibility in exchange of less durative powers. You can have multiple powers imbued in you, but they only last a scene.

Strength of the brew Some powers have a set difficulty. If a power has one, this is what you will be rolling. If they do not have a difficulty set in the description, then it works as follows:

* 0-1 successes: the brew fails, ingredients are wasted
* 2-3 successes: the brew works but it's weaker than expected. Could last less, takes more turn to activate, have weaker effects and so on
* 4-5 successes: the brew acts as expected
* 6 or more successes: the brew is stronger, has something extra, could last longer, could activate quicker. Everything to ST discretion.

Each success above 6 or criticals could have extra effects. The power may last longer, could have even more improved effects or could yeld an extra usage, in the case of Fixatio.

Counterfeit: You can recreate disciplines as counterfeits. You can recreate any power equal to your TBA -1, and they are considered a formula of that level \[example, if i have TBA 4, i could create a level 3 power of a discipline as a counterfeit. It would be considered a level 4 formula]. For higher level disciplines, \[level 3 or higher] you need the blood of someone that possesses the discipline \[not the power] as ingredient. For amalgams, you always need the blood of the specific clan the amalgams is specific to (or the blood of someone that actually knows the amalgam). For example, if i want to craft Feral Weapons, i would not need the blood of a kindred with the discipline as it's a level 2 power. If i want to craft Metamorphosis instead, i would need the blood of a kindred that has the discipline \[Gangrel, Tzimisce, Ministry - or someone that has learnt dots in the discipline] has it's a level 4 power. If i want to craft Vicissitude, instead, i would need the blood of a Tzimisce as it's an exclusive amalgam that is carried in their blood. Again, they don't need to know the actual power, as the amalgam is carried by the blood. When using a counterfeit, if the Power asks for a discipline roll, you use your rating in TBA instead \[for example, Compel requires a "Charisma + Dominate", but when used as a TBA counterfeit, it would be "Charisma + TBA" instead].

Ingredients: We follow the same rules as described in the corebook (p. 283). Counterfeits must carry the appropriate resonance and Counterfeits of an Amalgam need to have the resonance for both powers. When using a resonance as ingredient, the amount of it is the equivalent of a slake. Would it be a bag of blood, a slake worth of blood from a vessel or an herd dot, it's always a full slake. The more potent a brew is, the more expensive, rarer, illegal or generally hard to obtain the ingredients should be.

Using a distillation and paying the cost: Some powers you rouse when you create them and then rouse again when you activate them. Some powers rouse one time or the other, some none. That depends from the formula. The distillation roll is done when the brew is created and the player must take a note of it. Possible side effects are at Storyteller discretion and may or may not be revealed until the power is used.

Distillation time: The time needed to create a formula is dependant on how strong the power is. The time you spent creating a formula is mostly active, so you would usually be able to work on one brew at the time. Owning different labs could help with brewing multiple formulae at once if using Fixatio, the same way owning higher dots of >Herd could help with Calcinatio.

```
    ↳  Formula level - time needed
```

* 1-2 - A round or a scene. You can brew as many as you can in a night, assuming you are not busy brewing higher powers.
* 3 - A full night. You can't brew more at the same time unless your herd allows \[Calcinatio] or have multiple labs \[Fixatio]
* 4 - Only during time skip, you have 2 "slots" and so you can craft 2 level 4 formula during project week
* 5 - Only during time skip and it takes both "slots"

## Restricted or banned powers and advantages

* The Dominate power "Tabula Rasa" is banned
* The Presence power "Lingering kiss" requires explicit consent to be used on PCs.
* The Protean power "Serpent's kiss" is considered Ministry only and must be teached by a Ministry as if it was an amalgam.
* The Oblivion Ceremony "Maw of Ahriman" has the Oblivion Power "Arms of Ahriman" as prerequisite.
* The merit "Side Hustler" is banned until further notice.
* The merit "Semblance of the Metuselah" is banned.

* Haven and Haven merits can be off-balanced with Haven flaws, to a certain degree. Characters with the _'Decay'_ clan bane cannot make use of this alternate rule.
* Ritual Chaining is banned. They are too strong for this setting and extremely hard to achieve unless one powerplays.
* The ritual "Tiamat Glistens" is necessary to attune to a Furcus. This ritual can also be learnt as a Ceremony.
* The ritual "Compel the Inanimate" and the formula "Mask off" are approved, but pending review and playtesting. We feel like those powers do need a closer examination and to be seen in play, before deciding if they are 'too much'.
* The ritual "Stone of the True Form" is banned. It completely destroys multiple powers, disciplines, clans and whatnot.
* The Loresheet "Vienna Zero" is to be heavily moderated and the third dot is banned.
* The flaw "Banned from..." is banned.
* The "Descendant of Dracula Loresheet" (from _In Memoriam_) is replaced by our homebrew.
* The "Tithe Collector" Predator type doesnt fit our setting and so it's banned.
* The Presence powers "Melpominee" and "Thrown Voice" are to be considered amalgams, and the requisite is to have any dot in the "Stories of the Daughters" Loresheet.
* The merit "Enduring Fame" doesn't fit our chronicle and it's banned.
* The merit "Ley Line Leech" does not fit a stationary chronicle and it's banned.
* The merit "Persistent Blush" Has tgo be considered once per month/story/timeskip.
* The Flaw "Land Locked" does not fit a stationary chronicle and it's banned.
* The Loresheet "Succubus Club Copycat" is banned.
* All the powers, ritual, ceremonies from Fall of London are very incomplete and their systems dont make much for a game and so they are banned. (Ritual of transferring the Soul - Unseen Underground - Web of Hunger - Eyes of Beasts - Ventriloquism - The sun eclupses everything - The knowing stone - Vermin Vision - Clear the Field)

## Restricted Clans, Sects and Cults

Our aim is to have more opportunities available to everyone to pick from, but at the same time, it does happen that sometime the story or the lore do not allow some concept to be played within this chronicle. As such, also some extremely overpopulated clans might be locked or capped, depending on the server life and population. No one likes a court where the majority is only one clan.

* We strongly discourage  Indies, especially fledglings and neonates. We have found that they are very hard to include in plots and with the overall game and they do not thrive in this environment. The contested area are _not_ up for grab so easily.
* &#x20;Hecata are not considered Indies but their own sect.
* Bahari and Cultivars (of all types) are heavily monitored. Same goes for Nephilims and any other cult really.

Moreover, some clans have their affiliation set in stone in the lore and within the server metaplot. That means that is impossible for certain clans to be a part of a different sect from the default one.

* &#x20;Tzimisce and  Ministry are  Anarchs only. This include the variants such as Koldun Tzimisce and Sorcerer Ministry.
* &#x20;Lasombra and  Banu Haqim are  Camarilla only.
* &#x20;Hecata clans are  Hecata only.

There is no going around this rule and this decision, for the time being.

This is subject to change, depending how the story goes within the server. Maybe in the future, a group of player will be able to detach themselves from their original sect and create a faction on the other side. Also, those changes might happen in character, a character is allowed to change their sects during gameplay. It doesn't mean that it will be easy and without a proper preparation and a long planning, it would put the character(s) in extreme danger. Do this at your own risk.

Misc. Restrictions

* &#x20;Thinblood are very, very rarely embraced into the Hecata. As such, this concept would be rejected.
* &#x20;Thinblood can have access to Oblivion and Blood Sorcery through "_Discipline Affinity_" - Any character sheet with this will be heavily scrutinised as is really hard for such a specimen to thrive.
* &#x20;Caitiff neonates and fledglings cannot have access to Oblivion and Blood Sorcery at CC.
* Plague doctors and all associated rituals (Viral Haruspex, Egregore Consultation, etc etc) are banned. They don't fit the chronicles and the rules are vague at best, so we decided it wouldn't be an option for players.
