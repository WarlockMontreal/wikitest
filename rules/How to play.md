# Guide to Posting Etiquette

In our play-by-post game, creativity and personal expression are encouraged. However, maintaining basic standards ensures a smooth and enjoyable experience for everyone. This guide outlines the expectations for posting in a way that balances your unique style of roleplay with the structure needed to keep the story flowing effectively.

## Roleplay Your Way (Within Rules & Guidelines)
Write in the style that feels natural and enjoyable to you, while incorporating the essential elements outlined below.
Third person is preferred but not mandatory.

Flex your creativity, but make sure your posts contribute to the shared story, foster collaboration, and leave room for others to interact.

## What to Include in Your Post
Set the Scene:
 
↳ Describe your character’s actions, emotions, or surroundings to immerse others in the moment.
↳ Acknowledge Others: Respond to what other characters have said or done, ensuring a collaborative and engaging scene.
↳ Move the Story Forward: Include an action, thought, or dialogue that progresses the narrative.
↳ Leave Room for Interaction: Avoid “closing the door” on others’ ability to respond; create opportunities for further engagement and collaboration.

## Every post Starts with a Header
Begin every post with a header summarizing key details about your character. 

A header needs to include:
Character Name
Your location within the channel. Writing <#1131321457411100744> might not be enough, as you could be anywhere in Westmount
Notable visible Features or Conditions (ie Hunger, Willpower, active powers, Blush of Life)
Notable visible Merits and Flaws (ie Looks, Status, visible Loresheets)

Examples:

**["Mia Lavigne" | Westmount: outside the medical centre |  Looks: Stunning | Status 2: Camarilla Hound, Suspect (Anarch), Beacon of Profanity | Rapid Reflexes | Subtle Hammer | Humanity 5 | Hunger 1 | BoL On]**

As you can see, this at a glance tells you: 
- Who's the character
- Where they are
- Their visible merits (Looks)
- Their standing (Status - maybe you can know them already?)
- Their visible flaws (Suspect and Beacon of Profanity)
- Their active powers (in this case, all their powers are passive, so they are considered active)
- Their Humanity (a kindred looks and feels different at each level on the scale)
- Their hunger (do they need to roll frenzy?)
- If they have Blush of Life On or not (very important for the Masquerade)

Some people prefers to use the /header function from Inconnu. I personally don't massively love it, but to each their own. 
**Every post needs to have it's Header!!!**

### Always add the rolls you do to your posts!
When rolling for actions, clearly indicate the intent of the roll, as well as the attributes, skills, specialties, and other modifiers used.
Provide any associated rouse checks for powers, healing, or surging.

Example:

```[Rouse Check: Successful, Unseen Passage Activated]
[Siren Hunt: Charisma + Manipulation + Specialty - Seduction, DC 3 = 6 successes]```

it's important to keep track of those in the post as it's easier to reference them later on.

If using backgrounds, state how many dots are blanked and why:

```[Blanked out Resources 3 to purchase a SUV]```

### Exiting a Scene
When leaving a scene, include a note about where your character is headed:

[Exit to <#channel-name>]

This helps track your character’s movements and ensures continuity in the story.

## Rolling dice with Inconnu

With Inconnu is paramount to always update your sheet on the bot and ALWAYS use the traits to roll, not the numbers.

Example:
*Caine has to roll Dexterity + Athletics to dodge an attack. They don't need to check their sheet, as Inconnu does it for them. Instead of doing /roll 6 which would roll 6 dice, they need to type /roll Dexterity + Athletics.*

Doing it this way is extremely important, because it saves your roll statistics and then the staff can reference them later on when you want to improve your traits.
Also it ensures that everyone rolls with the right stats. There is no "oh i remembered i had more dexterity" in this way, and it ensures a fair model to everyone.

Any time this rule is not followed, a staff member might request to simply re-do the roll in the correct way, it doesn't matter what the original result was and if the amount of dice were correct in the first place. The rule is to always roll with the traits and not with numbers.
