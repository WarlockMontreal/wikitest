# Time and Time Skips

The game follows a real-time progression for the most part. One OOC (Out Of Character) day is roughly equivalent to one IC (In Character) night. However, to keep the story moving and allow for long-term projects, we utilize **Time Skips**.

## Weekly Structure
- **Active Play:** Most nights are dedicated to active roleplay, scenes, and immediate interactions.
- **The "Waking Up" Mechanic:** Every Monday (OOC), a new IC week begins. This is when you perform your `/awaken` command in Inconnu to reset your Willpower and check for hunger.

## Time Skips
A Time Skip is a period where we fast-forward the narrative, usually by a week or a month. During this time, characters are assumed to be performing their "routine" unlife—hunting, maintaining havens, and working on long-term goals.

### What happens during a Time Skip?
1. **Experience Gains:** You still receive your weekly experience points if you have been active leading up to the skip.
2. **Project Progress:** This is the primary time to progress **Projects** (such as researching Rituals, Alchemy, or building Influence).
3. **Hunting:** Characters are assumed to have hunted successfully to maintain their current Hunger level, unless they are attempting to lower it or look for specific Resonance.

## Projects
Projects are long-term actions that cannot be completed in a single scene.
- **Starting a Project:** Open a ticket to discuss the goal with the staff.
- **Rolls:** Most projects require a series of rolls (e.g., Intelligence + Occult for research).
- **Timeframes:** A project might take one or more Time Skips to complete depending on the complexity and the number of successes required.

## Special Note: The "Oceans of Time"
For Ancillae characters, the "Eras" they chose during character creation represent the ultimate "Time Skip"—the decades or centuries lived before the start of the chronicle. These eras determine your starting bonuses and flaws, reflecting how your character spent those vast stretches of time.
