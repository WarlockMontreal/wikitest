# Character Creation

Following the Rulebook Character creation, with slight edits regarding the age of the Characters.

# Attributes
- Take one attribute at 4, three at 3, four at 2 and one at 1

# Skills 
Pick one Skill distribution between Jack of all Trade, Balanced or Specialist

- Jack of all trades: One Skill at 3; eight Skills at 2; ten Skills at 1

- Balanced: Three Skills at 3; five Skills at 2; seven Skills at 1

- Specialist: One Skill at 4; three Skills at 3; three Skills at 2; three Skills at 1

[Specialist is advised for more experienced players that know what they are doing]

Add free specialties to Academics, Craft, Performance, and Science Skills if there is one or more dot invested in them.
Take one more free specialty.

# Disciplines
Choose 2 disciplines of your in-clan pool. Take 2 points in one, 1 point in another.
Caitiffs choose 2 discipline and do the same spread.
Thin-Blood characters have no intrinsic Discipline.

# Predator Type
Choose one of the Predator Types available.
Human players that receive the embrace in game will be able to get a predator type over the course of one or more timeskip.
Thin blood characters can take the discipline dot if they have a discipline affinity.

The predator types that give Oblivion and Blood Sorcery only give them if the character already has the Discipline in clan.
For example, a Hecata can take bagger and obtain a dot in Oblivion, a Brujah cannot take Oblivion.
This is valid for all the PTs that include Oblivion and BS and valid for all the clans that have them as their normal spread (even bloodlines).

# Conviction and touchstones
Choose between 1-3 convictions and associated touchstones.
No more than 1 touchstone can be an item. If the touchstone is an item, it needs to always be on the person. Otherwise, the character receives stains as if the touchstone was damaged. If the touchstone is lost, even if only temporarily, the character takes the same stains as if the touchstone was destroyed.
Characters can be touchstone as long as they are humans that do not know about the world of darkness. The moment a human (player character or not) gets to witness the atrocities and the curse of Caine, they can no longer be a touchstone. If a kindred with a human touchstone realises that the touchstone has been "contaminated" by the world of darkness (or if it became a ghoul or a kindred), the the touchstone is destroyed and they take the correct amount of stains. The touchstone must be replaced within a few nights (an ooc month) or the conviction will be lost.

# Add the chronicle tenets
- Do not kill if not for self defence
- Do not enslave or torture

In addition, there are chronicle tenets associated to the sect one's belong to:
- Camarilla: Follow the tradition
- Anarchs: Never betray the Movement
- Hecata: The family is above everything
- Independent: Do not bow to the will of the sects

The chronicle tenets *can* be willingly broken by the character.

# Merits, flaws and backgrounds.
- Every character has 7 points to distribuite between Merits, Backgrounds and Loresheets.
- There is an hard cap of 2 different loresheet at character creation. A bloodline or a 'descendant of' loresheet are not included in this limit. More loresheets will be available within the game.
- For backgrounds and loresheets, there is a soft caps of 3 at CC. There are some exceptions where a an higher level of a loresheet can be taken it at CC, but is really uncommon and it's at ST discreption. Also, while we usually approve loresheets at the third dot at CC, we do not approve more than one LS at that level.
- Ancillae characters have more loose restrictions, but they are still in place.

- Every character has 2 points of flaws. You can have more flaws than 2, but they won't give you any bonus or extra merit points

  # Age
- Childer or Fledgling
Embraced within the last 15 years. Their generation is 12th or 13th, with a blood potency of 1. Thinbloods can be 14th,15th or 16th generation, with a blood potency of 0.

- Neonates
Embraced between 1940 and a decade ago. Their generation is 12th or 13th, with a blood potency of 1. Thinbloods can be 14th,15th or 16th generation, with a blood potency of 0.
Their background story needs to be more detailed, with details including more about their kindred life.
They receive:
+ 15 experience point, to spend on top of the sheet when everything has already been added

- Ancillae
Embraced between 1780 and 1940. Their total age might not be over 300 years. Their generation can be as lower as 10th and they have a starting blood potency of 2 (except for thin blood characters, which will still be 14/16th gen with a blood potency of 0)
The background story needs to be extremely detailed and you can only create an Ancillae character after you've played in the server and received experience for at least 8 weeks. It is expected that you know the game and the lore at a good level before playing a character of this kind.
Additionally, they receive:
+ 35 experience point, to spend on top of the sheet when everything else has already been added
+ 2 extra advantage points
+ 2 extra flaw points
+ At least one Archaic Flaw (Page 180) to be included in the 4 starting dots of flaws
+ They lose 1 dot of humanity from the starting pool
+ Ancillae characters can choose between Focused or Strategic discipline spread.
> *Focused*: Put 3 dots into a clan discipline, 1 dot into another clan discipline and the last 1 dot into any discipline. (with the usual limitations). Caitiff characters will have those 3 as their starting disciplines.
> *Strategic*: Put 2 dots into 2 clan disciplines, 1 dot into the third clan discipline and then 1 dot into any discipline (with the usual limitations).
+ Ancillae characters can choose to use the [advanced Ancillae Character creation rules.](https://discord.com/channels/1131321454701580318/1140726390887559208/1375138053798101094) They are slighlty different from RAW so pay attention to those changes.


- Human characters
Simple humans can be played as well. They receives no disciplines, nor predator type. They do receive other possible bonuses. After all, they must be special specimen to survive in this tainted world
+ One extra point of humanity, raising their base pool at 8. They can choose to have less than 8 if they want to.
+ 5 extra advantage points, to be spent in advantages. Those 5 points of extra backgrounds will need to be reintegrated with experience if and when they are embraced.
+ They can not be embraced for at least 1 ooc month after their character creation.

A character can be created as a ghoul, but their domitor needs to be an active player. If a kindred character takes a player as a ghoul, they need to spend experience equal to having a 2 dots retainer (6 experience)

It's important to remember when creating such a character, that the game is mostly intended towards kindred characters. Humans have an hard time adapting to the whims of the creatures of the night and one needs to be particularly special (or useful) to be intertwined with the story of supernatural beings.

# Humanity

The humanity value of a character is noted at character creation and creates what i will refer as your base humanity pool.
A PC that loses humanity, can try to reacquire it at no exp cost up to your base humanity pool. For example, a kindred's base humanity is 7. If they drop to humanity 6, they can re-attempt to recover their lost dot of humanity at no exp cost. It will require multiple nights of 'good behaviour' to do so (and a talk with the staff on the modality). 
If they want to increase it to 8, they will need to pay the experience (which, in this game, is 3x) and once bought, it will be their new base humanity pool. If they, in the future, lose humanity, they can attempt to rise back to 8 at no cost.

Blush of life allows you to perform and even enjoy sexual intercourse as low as humanity 6 [the whole scale is lowered by 2 humanity levels]

Higher levels of humanity impose new chronicle tenets on the characters as follow:
> Humanity 8: do not kill or have monstrous intentions
> Humanity 9: do not harm, if not for self defense

Humanity 10 is unattainable, unless when retiring a character

# Experience 

Each week, there are multiple ways to earn experience points for your character

- 1 Experience point for waking up the character and posting at least 3 different emotes in a week. Remember, this is a post based game, so those posts need to be of enough lenght to qualify for your experience
- 1 Experience point for interacting with another character
- 1 Experience point for progressing personal or someone else's story. Reaching a desire, helping someone else to reach theirs, working on a project, meeting new people... Most times, you will get this point if you play a full scene or more.
- 1 Experience point for partecipating in STs led scenes
- 1 Experience point can be assigned for extremely evil acts (granting 3+ stains) or extremely 'heroic' acts (selfless acts that put your character in extreme danger or that result in a lot of damage but that help another person immensely, PCs or NPCs)
- 1 Experience point [up to maximum total of 5] for active staff members

In addition, for other rewards:
- 1-3 Experience points can be assigned by the STs if the character is involved in quests, important or dangerous scenes


Retiring a Character will award half of their earnt experience point (up to 50 - this number can change) towards the creation of a new character.
If a character dies, between 75% and 100% of their earnt experience points can go towards the creation of a new character, depending on the cause of their death.

There is a one month grace period in which one can make small amends to a sheet or change completely their character, after character creation.

# Expanded Ancillae character creation rules


An Ancillae can use the advanced rules as they are in the *"In Memoriam"* Rulebook, but those rules have been slightly updated to reflect our server and the game in a play by post setting.
Those rules are more complicated and while they might offer some advantages compared to the standard character creation offered in the corebook, the backstory need to be adequate to reflect the different *"Eras"* lived by the character and any attempt to powerplay through those will be dealt with accordingly.

Moreover, we don't use a random generation of the flaws, you simply pick which ones you want. ***Age, eras and predator type, combined, CANNOT bring humanity at a score lower than 4 and if they do, they can't be picked.***

# Attributes and abilites:
The same as the normal character creation.

# Discipline: 
You can choose between Focused or Strategic. 

- *Focused*: Put 3 dots into a clan discipline, 1 dot into another clan discipline and the last 1 dot into any discipline. (with the usual limitations). Caitiff characters will have those 3 as their starting disciplines.

- *Strategic: Put 2 dots into 2 clan disciplines, 1 dot into the third clan discipline and then 1 dot into any discipline (with the usual limitations).

# Convictions, Touchstone, Chronicle Tenets and Humanity
The same as the normal character creation. Before the Predator Type, the Generation and the Eras, your starting humanity is 7.

# Predator type:
The same as the normal character creation.

# Merits, flaws and backgrounds.
They are fully dependant on your Generation and the Eras.

# Generation: 
This will massively change the rest of the sheet, so pick carefully. It will also influence your blood potency and your starting advantages and flaws.

- *12th generation* - You will have Blood Potency 1
> While your blood is weaker than many of your contemporaries, you make up for it with mortal connection and acumen.
You have **8 dots of Advantages** and **12 experience points to spend on skills**.

- *11th or 10th generation* - You will have Blood Potency 2
> Like most ancilla, you are a cut above the average neonate in therms of power, but years of unlife have left their mark in the form of regrets, disadvantages and enemies.
You have **8 dots of Advantages** and **3 dots of flaws**.

- *9th or 8th generation* - You will have Blood Potency 3
> The strength of your Blood is almost on par with an elder, but the challenge of wielding it has led you down many dark roads, and your history is haunted by tragedy.
You have **5 dots of flaws**. You may take **2 dots of Advantages** at the cost of **a permanent loss of 1 dot of Humanity**.


# Oceans of time
Depending on your backstory and your generation, your character will have gone through different Eras in their unlife. Those might be events in their city, in their country, in their court, etcetera. They determine what your kindred has done in those centuries and it shapes their personality, history and sheet.

- For Ancillae Embraced up to 100 years ago, choose **3 Eras**. You will receive the Flaws of **1** of those. (This is recommended to Ancillae of the 12th Generation)
- For Ancillae embraced up to 150 years ago, choose **4 Eras**. You will receive the Flaws of **2** of those. (This is recommended to Ancillae of the 11th or 10th generation). Also, lose **1 permanent dot of Humanity**
- For Ancillae older than that, choose **5 Eras**. You will receive the Flaws of **3** of those. (This is recommended to Ancillae of the 9th or 8th Generation). Also, lose **2 permanent dots of Humanity**

# Eras

Those are the eras available. Those must be included in your backstory and it needs to make sense. All of those bonuses and maluses are cumulative with the Generation and the Predator type. Age, eras and predator type, combined, CANNOT bring humanity at a score lower than 4 and if they do, they can't be picked.

**Lose 1 Humanity** and gain **15 experience points** to spend on any Disciplines. This era can only be chosen once.
> *Flaw*: You gain the **Dark Secret Flaw (●)**. 

- A TIME OF SORCERY: You turned your mind to the sorcerous side of undead existence, finding secrets in the Blood.

> *Flaw*: You gain another 3 experience points to spend on the above, you also gain a **Cursed Object (•) Flaw**.

- TORPOR: You spent an era in torpor, hoping time would erase some of your mistakes.
