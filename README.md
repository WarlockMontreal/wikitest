Welcome to the official website for the Montreal by Night Discord Server, the preeminent server for all your Fifth Edition Vampire the Masquerade, and Play-by-Post desires. Contained herein is the penultimate guide to the server and its’ rules. Here you will find player expectations, character creation rules, guide to the Inconnu bot, as well as a directory for the cities locations, and the Coteries that lay claim to them. If you're ever unsure about something, then this is the place for you. Still unsure? Feel free to ask a staff member on the server!
